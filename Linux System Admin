Linux System Administration
●	Patching strategies, OS and software version management.	
    -Patching can be done manually or using a automation route.  
       -manually - by downloading patches and manually installing them on each individual device
          sudo apt-get update.
          sudo apt-get upgrade.
          sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.
          yum check-update.
          yum update.
          zypper check-update.
           zypper update.
       -Automation - by using a third party tool you can setup patching on multiple devices to run at a later date and it can be monitored.
       -Show patches installed
          rpm -qa shows all the packages installed
    -Type any one of the following command to find os name and version in Linux:
      cat /etc/os-release
      lsb_release -a
      hostnamectl
    -Type the following command to find Linux kernel version:
        uname -r

●	System Health - up-time, users, load of individual node.
    - uptime command – Tell how long the Linux system has been running.
    - w command – Show who is logged on and what they are doing including the uptime of a Linux box.
    - top command – Display Linux server processes and display system Uptime in Linux too.

●	System accounting -Users, Groups, POSIX security, ACLs
    - ACL
      - Format for permission types is Read (r) Write (w) Execute (x).  For example, rwxrwxrwx (OwnerGroupOther) Other can mean global access. 
      - ls -l - will list users and there rights to said folder or file 
      - Command used for user/group permissions to folders and files. Can be done on folder level or personal file level.  One can have access to a file but not a folder
        List of commands for setting up ACL :

           1) To add permission for user
                setfacl -m "u:user:permissions" /path/to/file

           2) To add permissions for a group
                setfacl -m "g:group:permissions" /path/to/file 

            3) To allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries from the directory it is within
                setfacl -dm "entry" /path/to/dir

            4) To remove a specific entry
                setfacl -x "entry" /path/to/file

            5) To remove all entries
                setfacl -b path/to/file
        
    - Groups
      - groupadd [OPTIONS] GROUPNAME
      - -f to force creation
      - Use the -g (--gid) option to create a group with a specific GID.
       - For example to create a group named mygroup with GID of 1010 you would type:
        - groupadd -g 1010 mygroup
       - When used with the -o (--non-unique) option the groupadd command allows you to create a group with non-unique GID:
        - groupadd -o -g 1010 mygroup
    - Hardware
      
    
        
●	Hardware - RAM, CPU, network, disk.
      -CPU
       - lscpu
      2. lshw - List Hardware
      3. hwinfo - Hardware Information
      4. lspci - List PCI
      5. lsscsi - List scsi devices
      6. lsusb - List usb buses and device details
      8. lsblk - List block devices
      9. df - disk space of file systems
      11. fdisk
      - free -m - Check Ram Amount
      16. hdparm - Commands gets information about sata devices
        - example - sudo hdparm -i /dev/sda

●	Network - IP, subnet, routes, multiple fabrics, IPv6
   
    ping: Checks network connectivity

    ifconfig: Displays the configuration for a network interface

    traceroute: Shows the path taken to reach a host

    route: Displays the routing table and/or lets you configure it

    arp: Shows the address resolution table and/or lets you configure it

    netstat: Displays the status of the network

●	Security - firewalld, SELinux, hardening strategies, Bro
    -firewalld

    -selinux
      -https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux

    -BRO
         - Bro is a free open source Unix based network analysis framework started by Vern Paxson. Bro provides a comprehensive platform for collecting network measurements, conducting forensic investigations and traffic baselining
      
●	Configuration Management (Puppet, Frabric, SaltStack) and provisioning (Razor, Foreman)
  - Puppet
    - An automation tool used to permform admin task such as adding users, installing packages and updates. 
    - Puppet uses a declarative language or Ruby to describe the system configuration. It is organized in modules, and manifest files contain the desired-state goals to keep everything as required. Puppet uses the push model by default, and the pull model can be configured.
    
  - SaltStack
    - Tool is used by making salt scripts to do various tasks.
    - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/saltstack/saltstack_configuration_management.htm
    
  - Frabric
    - another automation tool. 
    - is a python libary and command line tool for stramling to use of ssh for application deployment

●	Logging
    - /var/log - directory for logs on linux
    - to access cd /var/log
    - Syslog - located at /dev/log

●	Virtualization
      - Linux virtualization refers to a process where more than one virtual machine can be installed in the Linux operating system.It helps in the collaboration of the hardware and software resources of the Linux operating Software.
      - The Three Types of Virtualization

        -According to a Research and Markets report, client virtualization is expected to drive continual growth in the IT sector. ...
        -Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) ...
